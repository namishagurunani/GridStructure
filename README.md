# HTML file (index.html):
- You start with the usual HTML document structure with a '!DOCTYPE html' declaration and 'html', 'head', and 'body' elements.
- In the 'head' section, you define the document's metadata, including the character set, viewport settings, and the title of your webpage.
- You link an external stylesheet named "style.css" to your HTML file using the 'link' element. This connects your HTML file to the CSS file for styling.
# CSS file (style.css):
- You begin by setting the margin property for the body element to 0%, which removes any default margins around the body content.
- You define a CSS class called .container, which is applied to a div element in your HTML. This class sets up a grid layout with specific column and row properties.
- Within the .container class, you use the display: grid; property to create a grid layout. This grid has 16 columns, each spanning 6.25% of the container's width, 
  and 6 rows, each with a height of 6rem. The container itself has a fixed height of 36rem and a white border on a black background.
- You define classes like .g1, .g2, .g3, and so on, to target specific grid items within the container. These classes are used to position and style individual grid 
  items.
- Each grid item has properties like grid-area, grid-column, and grid-row set to position them within the grid.
- You define the .nav class within the .g1 grid item to style a navigation bar inside it. This class sets up a flex container with evenly spaced buttons.
- Buttons within the .nav class have specific styling, such as background color, text color, padding, and border radius.
- The .item class is a general class for styling all grid items. It gives them a white background, a border, and some margin and padding.
